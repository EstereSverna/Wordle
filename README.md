# Wordle
Wordle game prototype built using test driven development. At the moment created as console app without color code implementation, but in the near future will be developed in unity.

# The rules of Wordle

The challenge is to guess the mystery five-letter word in six tries.

Each guess must be a real word.

When you enter your guess, each letter is color coded:

    Correct letters in the right place go green
    Letters that exist elsewhere in the word go yellow
    Letters that don’t exist in the word go gray

So with each guess, you get a little closer. Get the word right within six guesses and you win.

It’s as simple as that.
